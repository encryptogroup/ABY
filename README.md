### Features
---
ABY efficiently combines secure computation schemes based on **Arithmetic sharing**, **Boolean sharing**, and **Yaoâ€™s garbled circuits** and makes available best-practice solutions in secure two-party computation.
It allows to pre-compute almost all cryptographic operations and provides novel, highly efficient conversions between secure computation schemes based on pre-computed *oblivious transfer extensions* using our [**OT extension library**](https://github.com/encryptogroup/OTExtension) available on GitHub.
ABY supports several standard operations and provides example applications.

This code is provided as a experimental implementation for testing purposes and should not be used in a productive environment. We cannot guarantee security and correctness.

### Requirements
---

* A **Linux distribution** of your choice (ABY was developed and tested with recent versions of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)).
* **Required packages for ABY:**
  * [`g++`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/g++)
  * [`make`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/make)
  * [`cmake`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/cmake)
  * [`libgmp-dev`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/libgmp-dev)
  * [`libssl-dev`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/libssl-dev)

  Install these packages with your favorite package manager, e.g, `sudo apt-get install <package-name>`.

* Optional packages: `doxygen` and `graphviz` to create your own [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) documentation of the code.

### ABY Source Code
---

#### Repository Structure

* `bin/circ/`    - Circuits in the ABY format.
* `cmake/`    - CMake helper files.
* `extern/`    - External dependencies as Git submodules.
* `src/`    - Source code.
 * `src/abycore/` - Source of the internal ABY functions.
 * `src/examples/` - Example applications. Each application has a `/common` directory that holds the functionality (circuit). The idea is to re-use this circuit even outside of the application. The application's root directory contains a `.cpp` file with a main method that runs the circuit and is used to verify correctness.
 * `src/test/` - Currently one application to test internal ABY functions as well as example applications and print debug information.

#### Building the ABY Framework

##### Short Version

1. Clone the ABY git repository by running:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY.git
    ```

2. Enter the Framework directory: `cd ABY/`

3. Create and enter the build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

4. Use CMake configure the build:
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```
    This also initializes and updates the Git submodules of the dependencies
    located in `extern/`.  If you plan to work without a network connection,
    you should to a `--recursive` clone in Step 1.

5. Call `make` in the build directory.
   You can find the build executables and libraries in the directories `bin/`
   and `lib/`, respectively.

##### Detailed Guide

###### External Dependencies

ABY depends on the [OTExtension](https://github.com/encryptogroup/OTExtension)
and [ENCRYPTO_utils](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ENCRYPTO_utils)
libraries, which are referenced using the Git submodules in the `extern/`
directory.
During configure phase of the build (calling `cmake ..`) CMake searches your
system for these libraries.

* If they are already installed at a standard location, e.g., at `/usr` or
  `/usr/local`, CMake should find these automatically.
* In case they are installed at a nonstandard location, e.g., at `~/some/path/`,
  you can point CMake to their location via the
  [`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html)
  option:
    ```
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/some/path/
    ```
* Otherwise, CMake updates and initializes the Git submodules in `extern/` (if
  not already done), and the missing dependencies are built together with ABY.
  If you want to do this without a network connection, consider to clone the
  repository recursively.

###### Test Executables and Example Applications

To build the ABY test and benchmark executables as well as the bundled example
applications, you use the `ABY_BUILD_EXE` option:
```
cmake .. -DABY_BUILD_EXE=On
```

###### Build Options

You can choose the build type, e.g. `Release` or `Debug` using
[`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html):
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# or
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
`Release` will enable optimizations whereas `Debug` includes debug symbols.

To choose a different compiler, use the `CXX` environment variable:
```
CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ cmake ..
```

###### Cleaning the Build Directory

Executing `make clean` in the build directory removes all build artifacts.
This includes built dependencies and examples.
To clean only parts of the build, either invoke `make clean` in the specific
subdirectory or use `make -C`:

* `make clean` - clean everything
* `make -C src/abycore clean` - clean only the ABY library
* `make -C src/examples clean` - clean only the examples
* `make -C src/test clean` - clean only the test application
* `make -C extern clean` - clean only the built dependencies


###### Installation

In case you plan to use ABY for your own application, you might want to install
the ABY library to some place, for example system-wide (e.g. at `/usr/local`)
or somewhere in your workspace (e.g. `/path/to/aby`).
There are two relevant options:

* [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html)
  defaults to `/usr/local` and is preprended by CMake to all installation paths
  (e.g. `lib/` and `include/` for library and header files, respectively,
  become `/usr/local/lib` and `usr/local/include`).
  CMake will also look for dependencies at this location.
* [`DESTDIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/DESTDIR.html)
  is used by the Makefile to install to a nonstandard location.

Example:
If you want to install ABY to `~/path/to/aby/prefix/{include,lib}` you can use:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=""
make
make DESTDIR=~/path/to/aby/prefix install
```
or
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/path/to/aby/prefix
make
make install
```


#### Developer Guide and Documentation
We provide an extensive [developer guide](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/media/encrypto/encrypto_code/abydevguide.pdf) with many examples and explanations of how to use ABY.

Also, see the [online doxygen documentation of ABY](http://encryptogroup.github.io/ABY/docs/index.html) for further information and comments on the code.


### ABY Applications
---

#### Included Example Applications

  * The [**Millionaire's Problem**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_Problem) was proposed by Yao in 1982. Two parties want to find out who is richer, without revealing their actual wealth. This simple example can be used as starting point for your own ABY application.
  * Secure computation [**AES**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), where one party inputs the key and the other party inputs a message to collaboratively encrypt.
  * The [**Euclidean Distance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) for two 2-dimensional coordinates.
  * The **Minimum Euclidean Distance** for finding the closest match between one d-dimensional element and a database of n d-dimensional elements.
  * The [**Arithmetic Inner Product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Algebraic_definition) that multiplies N values component-wise and then adds all multiplication results (modulo 16 Bit in this case).
  * Secure Hash Function Evaluation [**SHA1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1), where both parties concatenate their 256-bit inputs to a 512-bit message which is collaboratively hashed using SHA1.
  * The LowMC block cipher family [**LowMC**](http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/687), which is a block cipher family with a low number of AND gates and a low AND depth. In the example, one party inputs the key and the other party inputs a message to collaboratively encrypt.
  * Further example applications will be added soon.

#### Running Applications
  * Make sure you have build ABY as described above and set the
    `-DABY_BUILD_EXE=On` option and the application's binary was created in
    `bin/` inside the build directory.
  * To locally execute an application, run the created executable from **two different terminals** and pass all required parameters accordingly.
  * By default applications are tested locally (via sockets on `localhost`). You can run them on two different machines by specifying IP addresses and ports as parameters.
  * **Example:** The Millionaire's problem requires to specify the role of the executing party. All other parameters will use default values if they are not set. You execute it locally with: `./millionaire_prob.exe -r 0` and `./millionaire_prob.exe -r 1`, each in a separate terminal.
  * You should get some debug output for you to verify the correctness of the computation.
  * Performance statistics can be turned on setting `#define PRINT_PERFORMANCE_STATS 1` in `src/abycore/ABY_utils/ABYconstants.h` in [line 32](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY/blob/public/src/abycore/ABY_utils/ABYconstants.h#L32).

#### Creating and Building your own ABY Application
* To get an idea how to create a simple ABY application, you can follow the
  comments in the Millionaire's Problem example.

* If you are using CMake, install ABY somewhere it can be found and use
  `find_package(ABY)` or add the ABY repository as subdirectory via
  `add_subdirectory(path/to/ABY)`, e.g.
	```cmake
	find_package(ABY QUIET)
	if(ABY_FOUND)
		message(STATUS "Found ABY")
	elseif (NOT ABY_FOUND AND NOT TARGET ABY::aby)
		message("ABY was not found: add ABY subdirectory")
		add_subdirectory(extern/ABY)
	endif()
	```
	Then define your executable and link it to the `ABY::aby` target:
	```cmake
	add_executable(my_application my_application.cpp)
	target_link_libraries(my_application ABY::aby)
	```
* Otherwise, setup the include path such that the headers of ABY and its
  dependencies can be found and link your application to the `libaby.a`
  library and the other dependencies (see above).

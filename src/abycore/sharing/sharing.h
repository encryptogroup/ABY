	/*Note:
			The circuits are setup and executed into different phases: setup and online phases.
			In setup phase the implementation uses the baseOTs to compute OTs and use the OTs
			to communicate and compute the MTs. Online phase primarily deals with the rest of
			the circuit execution where the circuit evaluation is performed.
			Currently Precomputation scheme is only implemented for BoolSharing circuits or
	 	 	GMW based circuits. The implementation involves the use of 4 different modes of
	 	 	operation: PrecomputationStore, PrecomputationRead, PrecomputeInRAM and finally
	 	 	the default. In precomputationStore:  the MTs are computed for the specified
	 	 	circuit design and stored in a specific file(depending on the role) and the online
	 	 	phase of the circuit is skipped. In precomputationRead: the MTs are not computed
	 	 	again instead, read	from a specific file(depending on the role). Potentially, in
	 	 	this mode Setup phase is per-se skipped and focused on the online phase.
	 	 	In PrecomputeInRAM mode generally used with large iterations of circuits(similar to AES designs)
	 	 	we run the setup phase in the first iteration and use the result of the MTs in the
	 	 	following phases. Ideally such an implementation is not secure.
